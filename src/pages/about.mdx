# About

Hey, I'm Viraj Chavan, a Software Engineer graduated in 2018 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walchand_College_of_Engineering,_Sangli" target="_blank">WCE</a>, Sangli, India.

I love building and shipping things people will actually use and enjoy thinking about the user and their perspective as well as the technical solution.

I have been writing code since 2016, but my professional experience started in January 2019.

I like to travel, read books, ride a bicycle, build stuff, explore new things and more!<br />
I want to experience being a digital nomad for a while.
