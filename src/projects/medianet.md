# Apps at Media.net

This is at my current job at <a href='https://media.net' target="_blank">Media.net</a>.
I'm part of the team building web apps having more than a million impressions a day.

The project has a large team consisting several small sub-teams having different responsibilities.

My role in the team has been more on the front-end, with occasional changes/feature implementations on the backend.
On the front-end, I got to implement complex interactive **data-intensive UIs** in **ReactJs**.
On the back-end, I got introduced to **nodejs** and learned to use it to create services on the server-side. Also learned some PHP to make changes to some old code. **MySQL** as a the primary database with several Redis instances for the caching layer.

The scale in terms of number of users and code helped me understand the challenges involved in building **large complex systems**. I understood how efficient **caching** at different places can speed up our systems.

I also observed how product managers shape the products, something I was not exposed to before. At my previous work, this was something done partly by the developers. I have always been interested in the **product development**/product management and crucial it is to building great products.
