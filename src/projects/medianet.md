### Frontend for Apps at Media.net

This is at my current job at <a href='https://media.net' target="_blank">Media.net</a>.
I'm part of the front-end team building web apps having more than a million impressions a day.

The project has a large team consisting several small sub-teams having different responsibilities. I am part of the 3 people sub-team that handle the front-end and making things configurable on the back-end.

While most of the front-end was written in Vanilla JS with a few essential libraries, I got to write new parts of the app in **ReactJs**. Also modified related functionality on their server, which involved getting to know some part of the backend codebase written in PHP.

I also got introduced to **nodejs** and how it can be used to create server-side software.

The scale in terms of number of users and code helped me understand the challenges involved in building **large complex systems**. I understood how efficient **caching** at different places can speed up our systems.

I also observed how product managers shape the products, something I was not exposed to before. At my previous work, this was something done partly by the developers. I have always been interested in the **product development**/product management and crucial it is to building great products.
