### <a href='https://quickinsure.co.in' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:none; color:unset">Quickinsure</a>

This project was my first professional experience building full-featured software applications. I had joined <a href='http://joshsoftware.com/' target='_blank'>Josh Software, Pune</a> in January 2018. After a month of training, I joined the small team of 5 devs working on the product Quickinsure, an online insurance agrregator service for consumers and insurance brokers.

The tech stack was **Ruby on Rails** as the main backend which was coupled with an admin interface. The app also produced REST APIs which were consumed by two front-end apps: a consumer facing <a href="https://quickinsure.co.in" target="_blank"> website</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.callific.quickinsure&hl=en_IN" target="_blank">an Android app</a>. **MongoDB** along with Mongoid was used for the database.

Being the first big project that I worked on, I learned a ton working on end-to-end features. To summarize my initial learnings, I had written a <a href="https://medium.com/free-code-camp/what-i-learned-from-my-first-ever-software-development-internship-701aa756a72f" target="_blank">blog</a> about it, which got published in <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-i-learned-from-my-first-ever-software-development-internship-701aa756a72f/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. I also gave a <a href="https://youtu.be/Qysn40rvPFc?t=256" target="_blank"> 5-minute nervous talk</a> about it in <a href="https://www.deccanrubyconf.org/" target="_blank">Deccan RubyConf</a> 2018.

These were some of my responsibilities:
- To design, develop and test new features in the system (backend and frontend)
- To write REST APIs to be used by a Web Frontend and an Android App
- To build user interfaces in the Rails App using Slim/CoffeeScript
- To maintain the codebase, resolve production issues 
- To discuss business requirements with stakeholders and convert them into technical requirements
- To integrate a large number of third party APIs in the system, with regular communication with the API vendors

I worked on this project for about 1 year and 2 months, by the end of which I learned a significant portion of its large codebase. I learned a lot about Ruby, and the framework Rails. Understood its powers and its drawbacks and when it makes sense to use it.

I learned how to build robust APIs consumed by multiple clients, and to consume a large number 3rd party APIs in a sensibe way. Also got to know about ElasticSearch, and how to use it for efficient queries on huge sets of data. I learnt why we should write tests for at least the critical pieces of code, if not for all.
