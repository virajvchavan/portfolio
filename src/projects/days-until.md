I built this small Chrome extension in 2-3 hours because I wanted this functionality and there was no existing extension that did what I want.

There's nothing technologically difficult or interesting in this project. Anyone could write the the code.

What's interesting is after I published it on the Chrome Web Store, it grew to 3000+ active users organically. The only place I had publicized it was on ProductHunt.

Here are some stats (at the time of writing this, Jan 2020):
- 3000+ weekly active users
- High Chrome Webstore ranking for multiple related keywords
- Growing at 50+ new users per week
- 54% + users are from the USA, 12% + from Australia
- The extension popup has been opened 42k + times so far

I ended up selling it to someone for money worth my current one month's salary. I later realized it was worth a lot more due to the number of users it had!
