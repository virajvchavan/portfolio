### Game of Shares

<a href="https://github.com/virajvchavan/Game-of-Shares" class="project_linkouts" target='_blank'>Github</a>

I was in my 2nd year of engineering degree when I had this idea for a Share Market Simulator, to learn the basics of the share market and have fun while doing it.

Looking back, it was more of an enjoyable betting game on virtual stocks, than something that would teach you about the stock market.
But it was something that introduced me to the joy of building products!

I had already built an app using the LAMP stack before in the project <a target="_blank" href="/project/bookshare/">Bookshare</a>. I used the same tech stack again, and tried not to make the same mistakes I had made in the previous one.
